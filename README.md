 This Project is Based-on-(EDA) 'EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS'
 This project is all about how the Exploratoery data analysis work on any dataset.
 Before start anything first we need to arange specific environment like google colab  or jupyter notebook ,VS Code etc.
 Then import some important libraries  Pandas ,Numpy, Matplotlib, And Seaborn .
 After that we need to load our project Dataset - 'housing_data.csv'.
 Then we need to clean our new dataset that is housing data.
 This dataset have 1460 rows and 81 columns  so first i check its information about the dataset.
 Then i have got some columns are having null values so I handle them first.
 Then some columns names are not showing proper details about their content so I rename that columns.
 Then I have check all columns unique values and  value counts and and again checed null values .
 Some columns have 60 to 90 % zero values so we need to drop those columns.
 Then I checked finally cleaned dataset its shape , info , describe ,isnull etc.
 Now my dataset is ready to visualize in different different types of plots.
 Here I can perform Univariate,Bivariate,Multivariate Analysis to show the reletionship between Sale price to other columns trends.
 Reletionship between  Numeric v/s Numeric , catgorical v/s categorical, Numeric v/s categorical dtypes.
